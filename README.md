# Ethernet-ICMP Ping

ICMP ping library for the Arduino, modified the file structure to work with PlatformIO directly using the git repository link.

Then restart the Arduino software if necessary, and EthernetICMP should be available under the libraries dropdown.

## Update

This is the modified version of Arduino-Ping from Blake Foster by Github User masterx1981 

Since the masterx1981 fixes is built in to Ethernet library, i tried to move the ICMP out of Ethernet Libray to make it easier to add

Synchronus Version is TESTED and ALREADY WORKED, but the asynchronus version return some weird result to serial monitor

I also added some example if you want to use some DHCP using the Ethernet Library. Feel free to ask, create issue, pull request or make fork repository if you want.

## Issue

- Some memory leakage warning found if using Ethernet Library Version 2.0.0, try using newest version of Ethernet Library on Github
